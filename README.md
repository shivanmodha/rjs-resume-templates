Relaxed JS Resume Templates

> Yes, this readme needs to be flushed out. I'll get to it eventually.

## Template-01
This is a 2 pager template. But you'll notice there are 4 pages. First two pages is the left sidebar template, the last two pages are the right sidebar templates

Some details for you to get started:
 - Input file = template-01/src/main.pug
 - Output file = template-01/src/main.pdf

There are two styles for this one
 - Left sidebar
 - Right sidebar

## External Templates
It's probably important to mention that relaxed js already does come with a resume template [here](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed-examples/blob/master/examples/resume/resume.pdf).
